## Sam and Zeke
[In sillouete, a pickup truck bouncing down a dirt road]

Zeke:
	Welcome back home, Sam, how was the dance academy?

Sam:
	It was a *haaard*, I don't know if I want to back, to be honest.

Zeke:
	Aw, don't talk like that. We're all rooting for you.

	...

    Sounds like it's been rough though.

Sam:

	Yeah, it has been, dancing practice is brutal.

	Glad you're throwing this year's community party. 

Zeke:
	Oh?

Sam:

	It'll be nice to just be in a crowd tonight.

## Zeke arc
1) Earlier that week, Zeke is gatherting party supplies. Folks do a lot of wishing him "good luck!". This causes him some grief.
Sam: 
	How's it been, getting ready for tonight?
OVERLAY: Earlier that week
[Zeke is at Wilma's General Store, with miscellaneous supplies]

[Level: Gather supplies by matching them. etf run out of moves, ask Wilma for help finding something, this shuffles the board with at least one match, and spawns a powerup related to that item]

Wilma: 
	Thanks, see ya later, Zeke!

Zeke:
	No problem, see you at the party?

Wilma:
	Sure thing! Won't be able to stay long, though.

Store Patron:
	Good luck with the party, Zeke!
*wispering*
	especially after last year

[Back to Sam and Zeke]

Sam:
	Oof

Zeke:
	Yep, there was a lot of that when I went into town.

[Level: Unload supplies by matching over them, Sam helps out Zeke]

2) Set up the barn with Sam's help (aka get to make two swaps at a time)
	[TODO: Script interludes between Sam and Zeke?]

3) After guests arrive, Zeke goes around and greets folks, the pressure is on, but most folks don't make note of it. Gina who is a bit bookish and awkard, does note that Zeke seems tense.

[Level: Match cells so that folks to greet fall towards the bottom.]

Sally
Gina & Sam::: Zeke checks on Sam, since Sam and Gina have been talking a *lot*, Sam introduces Gina and Zeke, and then Sam and Gina go back to talking
Wilma::: After saying hi to Zeke, has to leave.

Walton::: Exchange between Walton and Zeke is a tense, but ends with Walton congratulating Zeke on not messing up the party so far.

4) 

5) Zeke cleans up the mess, notes odds and scraps and ends from the rest of the party
