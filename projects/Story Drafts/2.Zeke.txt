# Notes

    Need to build up Walton as intimidating to Zeke, also make note of his favorite food, and/or maybe the "standards" of the party he expects.

    Outline 

    1) Zeke has picked up Sam from the train station, both are on a ride to Zeke's
        - Talk about Sam's time at the Dance academy
        - Talk about Zeke getting ready for the party
            - Wilma splips Zeke a recipe for Walton's favorite party food?
    2) Zeke and Sam get the barn set up for guests
        - Zeke (the player) can set up two swaps
        - Sam can swap diagnonally, and will try to help. He can be told to not make a given swap.
    [time passes]
    3) Zeke greets and chats with the party guests, except for Walton
    4) Towards the end of the night, Zeke greets Walton, biting the social bullet, as it were.
    5) Zeke cleans up after the party

## Sam and Zeke
    
    [Zeke and Sam start to catch up]

    [In sillouete, a pickup truck bouncing down a dirt road]

    Zeke:
        Welcome back home, Sam, how was the dance academy?

    Sam:
        It was a *haaard*, I don't know if I want to go back, to be honest.

    Zeke:
        Aw, don't talk like that. We're all rooting for you.

        ...

        Sounds like it's been rough though.

    Sam:
        Yeah, it has been, the practice is brutal, and I feel like a object on stage.

        Glad you're throwing this year's community party. 

    Zeke:
        Oh?

    Sam:
        It'll be nice to just be in a crowd tonight.

## Zeke arc

### Getting ready for the party

1) Earlier that week, Zeke is gatherting party supplies. Folks do a lot of wishing him "good luck!". This causes him some grief.

    [Zeke and Sam talk about Zeke's prep for the party]

    Sam: 
        How's it been, getting ready for tonight?

    OVERLAY: Earlier that week

    [Zeke is at Wilma's General Store, with miscellaneous supplies]

    [Level: Gather supplies by matching them. If player runs out of moves, ask Wilma for help finding something, this shuffles the board with at least one match, and spawns a powerup related to that item]

    Wilma: 
        Thanks, see ya later, Zeke!

    Zeke:
        No problem, see you at the party?

    Wilma:
        Sure thing! Won't be able to stay long, though.

    Store Patron:
        Good luck with the party, Zeke!
    *wispering*
        especially after last year

    [Back to Sam and Zeke]

    Sam:
        Oof

    Zeke:
        Yep, there was a lot of that when I went into town.

    [Zeke and Sam arrive at the barn, Sam doesn't have a lot of luggage, they get ready to unload Zeke's pickup]


2) Set up the barn with Sam's help (aka get to make two swaps at a time)

    [Level: Unload supplies by matching over them, Sam helps out Zeke]

        [TODO: Script interludes between Sam and Zeke?]

3) After guests arrive, Zeke goes around and greets folks, the pressure is on, but most folks don't make note of it. Gina who is a bit bookish and awkard, does note that Zeke seems tense.

    [Level: Match cells so that folks to chat with fall towards the bottom.]

    ["Boss" level: Talking to Walton during the party (mechanics TBD)]

    Victor::: 
    Gina & Sam::: Zeke checks on Sam, since Sam and Gina have been talking a *lot*, Sam introduces Gina and Zeke, and then Sam and Gina go back to talking
    Wilma::: After saying hi to Zeke, has to leave to go do store inventory
    Sally:::

    Walton::: Exchange between Walton and Zeke is a tense, but ends with Walton congratulating Zeke on not messing up the party so far.

4) Zeke cleans up the mess, notes odds and scraps and ends from the rest of the party

[Level: Clean up mess by matching over it]
