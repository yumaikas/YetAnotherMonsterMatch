    Zeke:
        Welcome back home, Sam, how was the dance academy?

    Sam:
        It was a *haaard*, I don't know if I want to back, to be honest.

    Zeke:
        Aw, don't talk like that. We're all rooting for you.

        ...

        Sounds like it's been rough though.

    Sam:
        Yeah, it has been, the practice is brutal, and I feel like a object on stage.

        Glad you're throwing this year's community party. 

    Zeke:
        Oh?

    Sam:
        It'll be nice to just be in a crowd tonight.
