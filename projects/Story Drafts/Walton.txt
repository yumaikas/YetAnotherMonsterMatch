Walton notes

Walton is Sally's adoptive father, taking her under his charge when she was summoned and anchored to the Mortal Plane in a hexing accident. 

He and Victor have rival visions for the future of the Hamlet. Victor wants to secure The Hamlet as a Vetrinary Medical Center, Walton considers that to be lower in priority to establishing a Hexing Lab, to put The Hamlet on the Magical Map. 

He also wants the Zeke's party to go off without a hitch, so that the townsfolk will Move On and stop talking about The Incident.
