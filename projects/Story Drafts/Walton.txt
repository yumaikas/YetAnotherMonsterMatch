Walton notes

Walton is Sally's adoptive father, taking her under his charge when she was summoned and anchored to the Mortal Plane in a hexing accident. 

He and Victor have rival visions for the future of the Hamlet, though both have moved in the last 4 years. Victor wants to secure The Hamlet as a Vetrinary Medical Center, Walton considers that to be lower in priority to establishing a Hexing Lab, to put The Hamlet on the Magical Map. 

He also wants the Zeke's party to go off without a hitch, so that the townsfolk will Move On and stop talking about The Incident.

Outline of Levels/events

1) Sally interrupts Walton's work on a hex to ask Walton if she can go to the Party
    - Level is work on hex before interruption.
    - Absentmindedness of Walton is established here.
2) Walton prepares a warding hex for the barn, in secret.
3) Walton watches Victor *Closely* during party
    - Is interrupted by Wilma asking him to not give Zeke too hard of a time.
    - This interruption (unwittingly) provides cover for Victor to deploy his bat.
4) Walton tried to promote his Hexing lab to various folks, *except* Zeke.
5) Walton and Zeke talk after the party is *mostly* successful.
    - This level should be about assuaging Zeke.
