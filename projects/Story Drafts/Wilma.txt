# Wilma Notes

Wilma is a werewolf, or, a version of that where she's a wolf normally, and gets into Roid Mode, as it were, when the full moon comes out.

She is the proprietor of the town's general store, and generally a caring person.

Her and Zeke are childhood friends, she doesn't want to see his party fail, but has a lot of other things on her plate. 


1) Work customers through the general store
2) Close it up for the day, cleaning and such
3) Tries to convince Walton to go easy on Zeke.
4) Eat food and such to recover from the stress and prepare for the night of inventory.
5) Do inventory in "Werewolf" mode
