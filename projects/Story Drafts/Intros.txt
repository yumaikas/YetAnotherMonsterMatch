# Intros

## Sam and Zeke
[In sillouete, a pickup truck bouncing down a dirt road]

Zeke:
	Welcome back home, Sam, how was academy?

Sam:
	It was a *haaard*, I don't know if I want to back, to be honest.

Zeke:
	Aw, don't talk like that. We're all rooting for you.

	...

	I know it must be hard, though.

Sam:

	Yeah, it has been.

	Glad you're throwing this year's community party. 

Zeke:
	Oh?

Sam:

	It'll be nice to just be in a crowd tonight.

## Walton and Sally
[Walton and Sally leave "Myc's Hexes and Magicks"]

Sally spots the party announcement

Sally: 
	Ooh, ooh! Party tonight! Can we go, dad, pleeeease?!

Walton:
	*Sighs*

	I suppose we can, darling, it is only once a year.

Sally:

	YAAAAAY!

Walton, aside:

	And I can't wait to see how Zeke will mess it up.

	Especially after the mess he made when I hosted it last year.

Sally giggles

Walton:
	What was that Sal?

Sally:
	Oh, nothing!

## Wilma and Victor
[In a general store, Wilma is behind the counter, Victor is purchasing blood meal, bloodwort, and a rosebush]

Wilma:
	You see that the Community Party is at Zeke's this year?

Victor:
	Quite, I attended the council meeting where he petitioned for it.

	If nothing else, it'll make for an beautifully *tense* evening.

	Perhaps some veins will surface from the *pressure*

	Especially after *debacle* last year

Wilma:
	Now, don't you go causing trouble for Zeke!

Victor:
	I wouldn't *dream* of it!

Victor pays and leaves with his purchases

Victor:
	Bloodle-loo!

Wilma:
	Man, him and his blood hobby freak me out.

Wilma shivers, shaking off an icky feeling

Wilma:
	Pity that I have inventory tonight.

	I'd have liked to help watch things for Zeke.

	At least the moon will help me out tonight.

## Gina
Gina is unpacking boxes. She's managed to get about 5 out of 20 or so.

Gina:

	So many boxes left to unpack!
	
	At least I'll get to study the town history!

	One more, and then some lunch.

[Play a level of matching over box stuff?]

Gina:
	Man, I need something to eat.

Gina goes out to the town square and finds a restaurant, Myc's Munchable Meals. On the way back, she sees the announcement on the board.

Gina:
	A party? Awesome, I've been wanting to meet people here!



## Zeke arc
1) Earlier that week, Zeke is gatherting party supplies. Folks do a lot of wishing him "good luck!". This causes him some grief.
Sam: 
	How's it been, getting ready for tonight?
OVERLAY: Earlier that week
[Zeke is at Wilma's General Store, with miscellaneous supplies]

[Level: Gather supplies by matching them. If run out of moves, ask Wilma for help finding something, this shuffles the board with at least one match, and spawns a powerup related to that item]

Wilma: 
	Thanks, see ya later, Zeke!

Zeke:
	No problem, see you at the party?

Wilma:
	Sure thing! Won't be able to stay long, though.

Store Patron:
	Good luck with the party, Zeke!
*wispering*
	especially after last year

[Back to Sam and Zeke]

Sam:
	Oof

Zeke:
	Yep, there was a lot of that when I went into town.

[Level: Unload supplies by matching over them, Sam helps out Zeke]

2) Set up the barn with Sam's help (aka get to make two swaps at a time)
	[TODO: Script interludes between Sam and Zeke?]

3) After guests arrive, Zeke goes around and greets folks, the pressure is on, but most folks don't make note of it. Gina who is a bit bookish and awkard, does note that Zeke seems tense.

[Level: Match cells so that folks to greet fall towards the bottom.]

Victor
Sally
Gina & Sam::: Zeke checks on Sam, since Sam and Gina have been talking a *lot*, Sam introduces Gina and Zeke, and then Sam and Gina go back to talking
Wilma::: After saying hi to Zeke, has to leave.

Walton::: Exchange between Walton and Zeke is a tense, but ends with Walton congratulating Zeke on not messing up the party so far.
