# Intros

## Sam and Zeke
[In sillouete, a pickup truck bouncing down a dirt road]

Zeke:
	Welcome back home, Sam, how was academy?

Sam:
	It was a lot, I don't know if I want to back, to be honest.

Zeke:
	Aw, don't talk like that. We're all rooting for you.

	...

	I know it must be hard, though.

Sam:

	Yeah, it has been.

	Glad you're throwing this year's community party. 

Zeke:
	Oh?

Sam:

	It'll be nice to just be in a crowd tonight.

## Walton and Sally
[Walton and Sally leave "Myc's Hexes and Magicks"]

Sally spots the party announcement

Sally: 
	Ooh, ooh! Party tonight! Can we go, dad, pleeeease?!

Walton:
	*Sighs*

	I suppose we can, darling, it is only once a year.

Sally:

	YAAAAAY!

Walton, aside:

	And I can't wait to see how Zeke will mess it up.

	Especially after the mess he made when I hosted it last year.

Sally giggles

Walton:
	What was that Sal?

Sally:
	Oh, nothing!

## Wilma and Victor
[In a general store, Wilma is behind the counter, Victor is purchasing blood meal, bloodwort, and a rosebush]

Wilma:
	You see that the Community Party is at Zeke's this year?

Victor:
	Quite, I attended the council meeting where he petitioned for it.

	If nothing else, it'll make for an beautifully *tense* evening.

	Perhaps some veins will surface from the *pressure*

	Especially after debacle *last year*

Wilma:
	Now, don't you go causing trouble for Zeke!

Victor:
	I wouldn't *dream* of it!

Victor pays and leaves with his purchases

Victor:
	Bloodle-loo!

Wilma:
	Man, him and his blood hobby freak me out.

Wilma shivers, shaking off an icky feeling

Wilma:
	Pity that I have inventory tonight.

	I'd have liked to help watch things for Zeke.

	At least the moon will help me out.

## Gina
Gina is unpacking boxes. She's managed to get about 5 out of 20 or so.

Gina:

	So many boxes left to unpack!
	
	At least I'll get to study the town history!

	One more, and then some lunch.

[Play a level of matching over box stuff?]

Gina:
	Man, I need something to eat.

Gina goes out to the town square and finds a restaurant, Myc's Munchable Meals. On the way back, she sees the announcement on the board.

Gina:
	A party? Awesome, I've been wanting to meet people here!
