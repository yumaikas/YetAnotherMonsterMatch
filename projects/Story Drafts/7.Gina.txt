# Gina Notes

Gina, a ghoul, wants to write a History of the Hamlet, and The Hamlet, though small, has a *lot* of historical records. Victor is also an excellent source of... off the records history, and Gina has a lot of interest there.

Her and Sam have a lot in common, both having studied at the Academy.

Gina has moved around a *lot* of places in her life, and doesn't quite know who she is. 


Power: Every 2 matches, Gina can pick a single token to "capture" for study later, which removes it from the board.

1) Unpacking boxes
- Match over boxes to open, match next to the contents to put them away

2) Meet with Victor for lunch
- Talk about her trip and such
- Then talk about what she wants to study
- Victor invites her to the party

3) 

4) Gina works her way through the party
- Grabs food
- Talk to Walton
- Notice Sam

5) Gina and Sam talk
- Gina notices Sam, not from his disastrous performance, but from a club they'd both visited a couple of times.
- They then talk about the difficulties of the Academy
- Finally, Gina notices the time has flown, and that she should head back home, having had a good time.
