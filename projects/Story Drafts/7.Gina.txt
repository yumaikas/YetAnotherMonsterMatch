# Gina Notes

Gina wants to write a History of the Hamlet, and The Hamlet, though small, has a *lot* of historical records. Victor is also an excellent source of... off the records history, and Gina has a lot of interest there.

Her and Sam have a lot in common, both having studied at the Academy.

Gina has moved around a *lot* of places in her life, and doesn't quite know who she is.
