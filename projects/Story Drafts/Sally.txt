# Notes for Sally

Sally is an imp that was accidentally trapped on the Mortal plan in an hexing accidendent started by Walton. Walton has been taking care of her since then, and she's grown fond of the mortal plan, quite preferring life in The Hamlet vs the very beauracratic infernal planes which were quite grating to her young soul.

Zeke's party is the first time she's been to A Hamlet Party, so she's enjoying it a great deal. 

Her and Victor discuss her returning to the Infernal planes.
