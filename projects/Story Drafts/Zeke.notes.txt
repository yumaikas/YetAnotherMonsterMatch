# Notes

Need to build up Walton as intimidating to Zeke, also make note of his favorite food, and/or maybe the "standards" of the party he expects.


Outline 

- Zeke has picked up Sam from the train station, both are on a ride to Zeke's
    - Talk about Sam's time at the Dance academy
    - Talk about Zeke getting ready for the party
        - Wilma splips Zeke a recipe for Walton's favorite party food?
- Zeke and Sam get the barn set up for guests
[time passes]
- Zeke greets and chats with the party guests, except for Walton
- Towards the end of the night, Zeke greets Walton, biting the social bullet, as it were.
- Zeke cleans up after the party
