# Notes

Need to build up Walton as intimidating to Zeke, also make note of his favorite food, and/or maybe the "standards" of the party he expects.


Outline 

1) Zeke has picked up Sam from the train station, both are on a ride to Zeke's
    - Talk about Sam's time at the Dance academy
    - Talk about Zeke getting ready for the party
        - Wilma splips Zeke a recipe for Walton's favorite party food?
2) Zeke and Sam get the barn set up for guests
[time passes]
3) Zeke greets and chats with the party guests, except for Walton
4) Towards the end of the night, Zeke greets Walton, biting the social bullet, as it were.
5) Zeke cleans up after the party
