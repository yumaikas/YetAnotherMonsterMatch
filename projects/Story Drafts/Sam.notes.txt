# Notes for Sam

Sam has gone to learn Dance at The Academy, and it has been *brutal* for him, especially the spotlight.

He connects with Gina over stories of shared classes and academy traumas, and doesn't mind the attention from her like he does the spolight of dancing.

His levels focus on flashbacks and rumination and processing things.
