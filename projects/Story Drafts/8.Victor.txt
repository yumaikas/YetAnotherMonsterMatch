# Notes for Victor

Was turned by another vampire and left to die. Subsists on animal blood, which works well, but is *very* concerned with making sure that a ready supply of domesticated animals are available for his blood needs.

Victor has a blood fixation. Not necessarily sexaul, but he's *way* more comfortable with it than anyone else around him. 

He also has a much more discreet fascination with secrets and things that people don't want to share. He has definitely performed more than one act of low-level blackmail with the informaton thus gathered.

He has a *bat* that can walk more than you'd expect, and which he uses in his collection of gossip.

Outline of Levels/events

Progression 

1) Lurk around town, collecting gossip to get the tenor of the folks opinion on the party
2) Discover and try work around Walton's warding hex on the barn, but stop when get topped off on blood by Zeke (who is being a good host)
3) Have Bat sneak around Zeke's house, looking for potential leverage.
4) Try to convince Gina to speak up along with him on the Vetrinary Medical Center.
5) Retrieve Bat from the house without getting caught doing so.


# Intro

## Wilma and Victor
    [In a general store, Wilma is behind the counter, Victor is purchasing blood meal, bloodwort, and a rosebush]

    Wilma:
        You see that the Community Party is at Zeke's this year?

    Victor:
        Quite, I attended the council meeting where he petitioned for it.

        If nothing else, it'll make for an beautifully *tense* evening.

        Perhaps some veins will surface from the *pressure*

        Especially after *debacle* last year

    Wilma:
        Now, don't you go causing trouble for Zeke!

    Victor:
        I wouldn't *dream* of it!

    Victor pays and leaves with his purchases

    Victor:
        Bloodle-loo!
