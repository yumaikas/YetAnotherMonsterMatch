# Notes for Sally

Sally is an imp that was accidentally trapped on the Mortal plan in an hexing accidendent started by Walton. Walton has been taking care of her since then, and she's grown fond of the mortal plan, quite preferring life in The Hamlet vs the very beauracratic infernal planes which were quite grating to her young soul.

Zeke's party is the first time she's been to A Hamlet Party, so she's enjoying it a great deal. 

Her and Victor discuss her returning to the Infernal planes.

Generally, Sally's arc is going to be a lot more lighthearted than everyone elses

Power: Sally can ignite a match, causing all of the matching-color strands next to it to catch martch

Needs charge

1) Sally finds a flyer for the party as she's decorating part of the living room(?)
    - Is working on getting things into the "right" spots (what mechanics do we want to use?)
    - Spot flyer, interrupt Walton for it.
    - Finish decorating room
    - Build checklist for party that says
        "Talk to Everyone"
        "Try every food"
        "Find good Jokes"

2) Sally bounces around saying at least hi to everyone other than Walton, who she thinks she knows.
3) Sally tries a lot of different foods at the party (which is a level), and tries to pick a best food at the party.
4) Sally talks to a lot of folks, goes looking for jokes, and looks for times to interject
    - Sally and Victor end up talking some about her and the Infernal planes.
5) Sally ends up wearing herself out with her energetic participation, and ends up napping, and having a dream of home.
