# Notes for Victor

Was turned by another vampire and left to die. Subsists on animal blood, which works well, but is *very* concerned with making sure that a ready supply of domesticated animals are available for his blood needs.

Victor has a blood fixation. Not necessarily sexaul, but he's *way* more comfortable with it than anyone else around him. 

He also has a much more discreet fascination with secrets and things that people don't want to share. He has definitely performed more than one act of low-level blackmail with the informaton thus gathered.

He has a *bat* that can walk more than you'd expect, and which he uses in his collection of gossip.

# Intro

## Wilma and Victor
    [In a general store, Wilma is behind the counter, Victor is purchasing blood meal, bloodwort, and a rosebush]

    Wilma:
        You see that the Community Party is at Zeke's this year?

    Victor:
        Quite, I attended the council meeting where he petitioned for it.

        If nothing else, it'll make for an beautifully *tense* evening.

        Perhaps some veins will surface from the *pressure*

        Especially after *debacle* last year

    Wilma:
        Now, don't you go causing trouble for Zeke!

    Victor:
        I wouldn't *dream* of it!

    Victor pays and leaves with his purchases

    Victor:
        Bloodle-loo!
