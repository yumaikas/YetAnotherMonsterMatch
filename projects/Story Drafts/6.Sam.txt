# Notes for Sam

Sam has gone to learn Dance at The Academy, and it has been *brutal* for him, especially the spotlight.

He connects with Gina over stories of shared classes and academy traumas, and doesn't mind the attention from her like he does the spolight of dancing.

His levels focus on flashbacks and rumination and processing things.


1) Processing the events of the semester while absentmindedly watching the view out of the train.
    - Events to be processed come down as cells, and get processed as they get matched against
    - 
2) Help Zeke set up the barn for guests.
    - Zeke can swap twice, and will try to help match things, but can be told to not do a given swap.
    - Sam can swap diagonally due to the dexterity he's been training at the academy
3) 
4) Have a conversation with Gina about The Academy.
    - Get two diagonal swaps, as Sam's conversational adrenaline is running higher atm.
5) Revisit Sam's last disastrous performance
    -

    Zeke:
        Welcome back home, Sam, how was the dance academy?

    Sam:
        It was a *haaard*, I don't know if I want to back, to be honest.

    Zeke:
        Aw, don't talk like that. We're all rooting for you.

        ...

        Sounds like it's been rough though.

    Sam:
        Yeah, it has been, the practice is brutal, and I feel like a object on stage.

        Glad you're throwing this year's community party. 

    Zeke:
        Oh?

    Sam:
        It'll be nice to just be in a crowd tonight.
